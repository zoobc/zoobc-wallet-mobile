  <h2>{{ "overview" | translate}}</h2>
  <p>
    ZooBc wallet is a mobile application used to interact with the ZooBC blockchain. It is used to manage normal and
    multisignature accounts, broadcast new transactions to the network and view transaction records, create and manage
    escrowed transactions, and manage Blockchain Objects (Digital Tweens).
  </p>

  <h2>{{ "Purpose" | translate}}</h2>
  <p>
    This mobile app connects with ZooBC, a blockchain architected for non financial use cases. This application allows
    to operate several kind of native ZooBC transactions. A user friendly interface for multisignature, escrowed
    transactions, and other functionalities is the aim Quasisoft (part of the Blockchain Zoo group of companies) has to
    bring blockchain to the masses.
  </p>

  <h2>{{ "Status" | translate}}</h2>
  <p>
    Many transaction types already available in the core node software are not yet available in the mobile app user
    interface. We will roll them out as we implement and test them. In the meanwhile you can also use our web wallet for
    node registration and other ZooBC functions.
